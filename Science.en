my calorimetric investigations have led to a series of striking discoveries that initiated number of theoretical works. - 1 - in the superconducting state , in zero field , a pair-breaking effect is caused by anion disorder , similar to the effect caused by magnetic impurities in a conventional superconductor. - 2 - at low field ( b<8t ) , the metal-fisdw transition exhibits a weak coupling character. - 3 - some transitions are partially reentrant. - 4 - the specific heat jump at the transition - i.e. , the coupling strength ! - oscillates as a function of the magnetic field , and its value presents discontinuities at the limits between quantized sdw phases. - 5 - in higher fields , the system enters a strong coupling limit ( even very strong ). - 6 - the behavior appears to evolve from 3d towards 2d when crossing the border. - 7 - thermal conductivity seems to be dominated by lattice vibrations , however the critical behavior is associated with the electronic transition. - 8 - close to the end of the cascade of transitions , the latter become exothermic whatever the sweeping direction through the last transition line , the signature of a highly irreversible behavior. - 9 - for a sample cooled slowly enough through the anion ordering transition , these transition lines separate during an iterative process , leading to the observation of an arborescent phases diagram. - 10 - we have revealed the existence of a tetracritical point , which corresponds to the meeting of four transition lines in a single point. - 11 - as anion disorder is increased , the tetracritical behavior evolves towards a bicritical one , the arborescence of the transition lines disappears , and we observe a pair-breaking effect similar to the one observed in the superconducting phase of the same compound , however of a much larger magnitude .
